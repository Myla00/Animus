### E-Mail Layout: <br>
So basically, we need three main things: <br>
	1.  Value Punch (Meat), <br>
	2. Animus World building and <br>
	3. Info (Potatoes), and <br>
	4. Trimmings (Fun, Cartoon, etc) for each email. <br>
	(For the last two, I have detailed 27 items each of Animus Facts and <br>
	Cartoons/Fun that we can add, and we just need to come up with 27 meat-main ideas for the rest of it!)<br>
